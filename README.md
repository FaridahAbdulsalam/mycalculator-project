Title: 
JavaScript Calculator Project - My Calculator

Project Description: 
This web application provides the user with a simple yet effective online calculator. Users can input simple calculations and the calculator will return the correct mathematical answer. In this project I have utilised Javascript/Typescript, SASS and HTML. 

Challenges: 
The biggest challenge I faced was getting my calculator to do chain calculations, so the user could enter multiple numbers and operators and the calculator return accurate answers. Unfortunately I was not able to overcome this hurdle this time, but I definately will when I come back to improve this application. Other features I hope to include will be more interactive parts such as a confetti spray when the answer is returned and a dropdown box so the use can choose between scientic or standard. Maybe even a way to store all thier previous calculations , like a history bar. 

How to Install and Run: 
To install and run this project, you need to run npm install and then npm run dev to deploy the site.

Navigating the project: 
The project UI is quite self explanitory, have fun using the toggle! As for my code, you can navigate through the main.ts file which contains all my functionality, index.html to see how I layed out my page and styles.scss to take a look at the applied styles. I have also used partials to make my styling clearer.

Thank you!
